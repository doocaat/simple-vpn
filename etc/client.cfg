# This is the end-point to which the client will connect.

# This is the shared-secret, this key must match the one specified upon

##
## Optional settings now follow
##


##
## Every time a client connects to the server it sends a name, which the server
## may choose to use to assign a static IP address.
##
## If you have multiple hosts with identical names you can send an explicit
## alternative here.  (For example if you have "www.example.com" and
## "www.example.net" both hosts might be named "www".)
#
# name = frodo
#


##
## When the client connects to the VPN server it will launch a series
## of commands to configure IP, route, and gateway.
##
## If you wish you may configure a command to execute after that.  This
## "up" command will receive details of the link via environmental
## variables:
##
##  $DEVICE    -  e.g. tun0.
##  $CLIENT_IP -  e.g. 10.0.0.2.
##  $SERVER_IP -  e.g. 10.0.0.1.
##  $SUBNET    -  e.g. 10.0.0.0/24.
##  $MTU       -  e.g. 1280.
##
#
# up = /etc/simple-vpn/blah.sh
#


##
## When a new client joins the VPN, or an existing connection is
## terminated, then the server will send a refresh-message to each
## of the connected peers.
##
## The update contains the name & IPs of each client which is currently
## connected.
##
## If you wish to react to changes you can define a `peers` command
## here which will receive the list of connected names/IPs as a JSON
## object on STDIN
##
## Sample input might look like this:
##
##   [ {"Name":"vpn-server","IP":"10.137.248.1"},
##     {"Name":"www.vpn","IP":"10.137.248.2"},
##     {"Name":"alert.vpn","IP":"10.137.248.3"} ]
##
##
#
# Here we just dump them to the console.
#
# peers = /bin/cat
#
